We present Xenakis, a tool for the musification of urban data, which is able to capture some features of a city's topology through the distribution of street orientations, and turn it into a (very) small piece of music, a loop, which can be used as building block for compositions. Besides providing complementary visual and auditory channels to interface with this data, we also allow the piping of \textit{midi} signals to other applications. This concept was developed by visualization researchers collaborating with musicians using design study methodologies in an open-ended way. Our results include musical tracks, and we take advantage of the scope of alt.vis to communicate our research in a sincere, humorous, and engaging format.},

Investigators use sophisticated data manipulation and visualization tools to identify the travel history of stolen assets. With these capabilities, chain hopping, round-tripping, and all attempts to blur transfer trails by cyber criminals become smoke screens with no effect. This paper establishes a framework for investigating financial crimes on the blockchain, starting with a brief explanation of blockchain forensics, types of financial crimes committed by criminals using the blockchain, and how they can be mitigated using OSINT’s (OSINT, 2022) investigation process of data collection, data preservation, data processing, and data presentation. This paper also presents a community-based approach to financial crime investigations on the blockchain that involves the public and victims themselves contributing valuable intelligence that can be used to trace and track criminals by authorities and security agencies in the global fight against cybercrime.},

	abstract     = {Networks are abstract and ubiquitous data structures, defined as a set of data points and relationships between them. Network visualization provides meaningful representations of these data, supporting researchers in understanding the connections, gathering insights, and detecting and identifying unexpected patterns. Research in this field is focusing on increasingly challenging problems, such as visualizing dynamic, complex, multivariate, and geospatial networked data. This ever-growing, and widely varied, body of research led to several surveys being published, each covering one or more disciplines of network visualization. Despite this effort, the variety and complexity of this research represents an obstacle when surveying the domain and building a comprehensive overview of the literature. Furthermore, there exists a lack of clarification and uniformity between the terminology used in each of the surveys, which requires further effort when mapping and categorizing the plethora of different visualization techniques and approaches. In this paper, we aim at providing researchers and practitioners alike with a “roadmap” detailing the current research trends in the field of network visualization. We design our contribution as a meta-survey where we discuss, summarize, and categorize recent surveys and task taxonomies published in the context of network visualization. We identify more and less saturated disciplines of research and consolidate the terminology used in the surveyed literature. We also survey the available task taxonomies, providing a comprehensive analysis of their varying support to each network visualization discipline and by establishing and discussing a classification for the individual tasks. With this combined analysis of surveys and task taxonomies, we provide an overarching structure of the field, from which we extrapolate the current state of research and promising directions for future work.},

As more techniques are developed and published, a clear need for evaluation and experimental comparisons between them emerges. Most studies explore the temporal dimension and diverse interaction techniques supporting the participants, focusing on a single structural representation. Empirical evidence about performance and preference for different visualization approaches is scattered over different studies, experimental settings, and tasks. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the dynamic network visualization design space in two evaluations. First, a controlled study assessing participants' response times, accuracy, and preferences for different combinations of network structural and temporal representations on typical dynamic network exploration tasks, with and without the support of standard interaction methods. Second, the best-performing combinations from the first study are enhanced based on participants' feedback and evaluated in a heuristic-based qualitative study with visualization experts on a real-world network. Our results highlight node-link with animation and playback controls as the best-performing combination and the most preferred based on ratings. Matrices achieve similar performance to node-link in the first study but have considerably lower scores in our second evaluation. Similarly, juxtaposition exhibits evident scalability issues in more realistic analysis contexts.},

We investigate the design space of dynamic graph visualization along two major dimensions: the network structural and temporal representation.

We conduct a study where we assess the participants’ response times, accuracy, and preferences for different combinations of the graph’s structural and temporal representations on typical dynamic network exploration tasks, with and without support of common interaction methods. Our results suggest that matrices provide better support for tasks on lower-level entities and basic interactions require longer response times while increasing accuracy. Node-link with auto animation proved to be the quickest and most accurate combination overall, while animation with playback control the most preferred temporal encoding.},

Our approach is a circular visualization that is flexible and transparent to the underlying subject. It uses event-based networks as inputs, considering the existence of a small set of entities in space and time: people, places, events, and themes. This minimal model is powerful enough to represent many facets of historical subjects and explore trends and narratives mainly through their temporal and spatial developments, serving as visual analytical support to humanists.},

For the essential temporal dimension, it offers four different views: superimposition, animation, juxtaposition, and space-time cube representations.

With this paper we reflect on ways and means how to shed light on the life of artists or other historical actors by the means of metadata provided by their ouevre. By representing the works of Charles W. Cushman in the PolyCube framework for cultural collection visualization, we shed light on aspects of his biography in a geo-temporal and categorial-temporal information space.

A typical CV is comprised of multiple sections associated with spatio-temporal, nominal, hierarchical, and ordinal data. The main task of a recruiter is, given a job application with specific requirements, to compare and assess CVs in order to build a short list of promising candidates to interview. Commonly, this is done by viewing CVs in a side-by-side fashion. This becomes challenging when comparing more than two CVs, because the reader is required to switch attention between them. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the CVs are structured similarly, thus making the overview cluttered and significantly slowing down the comparison process. In order to address these challenges, in this paper we propose "CV3", an interactive exploration environment offering users a new way to explore, assess, and compare multiple CVs, to suggest suitable candidates for specific job requirements. We validate our system by means of domain expert feedback whose results highlight both the efficacy of our approach and its limitations.

To make these levels of data quality transparent, the visualization of uncertainty poses a vital challenge for interfaces across the board. We introduce the PolyCube system as a visualization framework which provides four different perspectives on the geo-temporal origins of cultural collection data, including coordinated multiple views, animation, color coding, and a space-time cube representation. With specific regard to this multi-perspective framework we develop options to visualize spatio-temporal uncertainty and discuss ways and means of their coherent implementation.}

It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a clear overview when comparing multiple resumes, specifically their chronological information. Navigating back and forth between resumes, switching between views and attempting to compare every single event is highly inefficient. The most common and intuitive way to compare events from multiple resumes, would be to view them in a side-by-side fashion. Many similarities can be quickly recognized by doing this, but in cases where more than two resumes need to be compared simultaneously, the overview becomes cluttered, the amount of information increases substantially and comparing events becomes a difficult task. We propose the design and implementation of a web application - CV3 - that is capable of comparing multiple chronologies and visualizing the output in a clear manner, whilst maintaining a clean overview. Our approach supports users in filtering timeline events across all resumes, recognizing and extracting relevant information from resumes and visualizing their similarities efficiently in a single overview.},

Here, we are interested in the visualization of uncertainty within the context of multivariate graphs, specifically the visualization of uncertainty attached to node attributes. Many visual channels offer themselves up for the visualization of node attributes and their uncertainty. One controversial and relatively under-explored channel, however, is animation, despite its conceptual advantages. In this paper, we investigate node “wiggliness”, i.e. uncertainty-dependent pseudo-random motion of nodes, as a potential new visual channel with which to communicate node attribute uncertainty. To study wiggliness’ effectiveness, we compare it against three other visual channels identified from a thorough review of uncertainty visualization literature—namely node enclosure, node fuzziness, and node color saturation. In a larger-scale, mixed method, Prolific-crowd-sourced, online user study of 160 participants, we quantitatively and qualitatively compare these four uncertainty encodings across eight low-level graph analysis tasks that probe participants’ abilities to parse the presented networks both on an attribute and topological level. We ultimately conclude that all four uncertainty encodings appear comparably useful—as opposed to previous findings. Wiggliness may be a suitable and effective visual channel with which to communicate node attribute uncertainty, at least for the kinds of data and tasks considered in our study.},

HoloGraphs addresses the challenges of visualizing and understanding evolving network structures by providing an engaging method of interacting and exploring dynamic network structures using physicalization techniques. In contrast to traditional digital interfaces, our approach leverages tangible artifacts made from transparent materials to provide an intuitive way for people with low visualization literacy to explore network data. The process involves printing network embeddings on transparent media and assembling them to create a 3D representation of dynamic networks, maintaining spatial perception and allowing the examination of each timeslice individually. Interactivity is envisioned using optional Focus+Context layers and overlays for node trajectories and labels. Focus layers highlight nodes of interest, context layers provide an overview of the network structure, and global overlays show node trajectories over time. In this paper, we outline the design principles and implementation of HoloGraphs and present how elementary digital interactions can be mapped to physical interactions to manipulate the elements of a network and temporal dimension in an engaging matter. We demonstrate the capabilities of our concept in a case study. Using a dynamic network of character interactions from a popular book series, we showcase how it represents and supports understanding complex concepts such as dynamic networks.},

This survey presents a comprehensive review of the intersection between art history and visual analytics, focusing on network visualization and how it supports researchers in analyzing and understanding complex art historical relationships through nodes (e.g., artists, artworks, institutions) and edges (the relationships between them). We explore how these approaches enable dynamic analysis, offering novel perspectives on artistic influence, stylistic evolution, and social interactions within the art world. Through this, we also examine wedges, a metaphor for the friction often present in art history between individuals and institutions. These tensions, which have historically played a pivotal role in shaping artistic movements, are now better understood through the lens of network visualization, revealing how conflicts and power dynamics influenced the development of art. Through a hierarchical categorization of the literature, we outline saturated problems and research areas as well as ongoing challenges in art historical research. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of visual analytics to bridge the gap between traditional qualitative research and modern computational analysis, offering interactive exploration, temporal analysis, and complex network visualization. We provide a structured foundation for future research in art history, emphasizing the value of network visualization in enriching the understanding of art history.},

Conformance checking is often limited to analyzing the control flow (i.e., sequences of activities), while other relevant perspectives present in the data, such as resources and time, are frequently overlooked. These additional perspectives are crucial to form a holistic understanding of deviations and their underlying causes. To address these limitations, we propose a conceptual framework and explore future opportunities for integrating VA with PM to support conformance checking from multiple perspectives. Our contribution emphasizes interactive visualization and analysis for a more flexible and iterative conformance checking process by, for example, allowing to dynamically refine and define additional constraints based on insights from multiple perspectives and making all deviations explainable and understandable.},

This study investigates the impact of personal construction on the comprehension of physicalized networks. We propose a physicalization toolkit—NODKANT—for constructing modular node-link diagrams consisting of a magnetic surface, 3D printable and stackable node labels, and edges of adjustable length. In a mixed-methods between-subject lab study with 27 participants, three groups of people used NODKANT to complete a series of low-level analysis tasks in the context of an animal contact network. The first group was tasked with freely constructing their network using a sorted edge list, the second group received step-by-step instructions to create a predefined layout, and the third group received a pre-constructed representation. While free construction proved on average more time-consuming, we show that users extract more insights from the data during construction and interact with their representation more frequently, compared to those presented with step-by-step instructions. Interestingly, the increased time demand cannot be measured in users' subjective task load. Finally, our findings indicate that participants who constructed their own representations were able to recall more detailed insights after a period of 10–14 days compared to those who were given a pre-constructed network physicalization.

	abstract     = {From social networks to brain connectivity, ego networks are a simple yet powerful approach to visualizing parts of a larger graph, i.e. those related to a selected focal node — the so-called “ego”. While surveys and comparisons of general graph visualization approaches exist in the literature, we note (i) the many conflicting results of comparisons of adjacency matrices and node-link diagrams, thus motivating further study, as well as (ii) the absence of such systematic comparisons for ego networks specifically. In this paper, we propose the development of empirical recommendations for ego network visualization strategies. First, we survey the literature across application domains and collect examples of network visualizations to identify the most common visual encodings, namely straight-line, radial, and layered node-link diagrams, as well as adjacency matrices. These representations are then applied to a representative, intermediate-sized network and subsequently compared in a large-scale, crowd-sourced user study in a mixed-methods analysis setup to investigate their impact on both user experience and performance. Within the limits of this study, and contrary to previous comparative investigations of adjacency matrices and node-link diagrams (outside of ego networks specifically), participants performed systematically worse when using adjacency matrices than those using node-link diagrammatic representations. Similar to previous comparisons of different node-link diagrams, we do not detect any notable differences in participant performance between the three node-link diagrams. Lastly, our quantitative and qualitative results indicate that participants found adjacency matrices harder to learn, use, and understand than node-link diagrams. We conclude that in terms of both participant experience and performance, a layered node-link diagrammatic representation appears to be the most preferable for ego network visualization purposes.},

Recently, event-based networks emerged as an approach to model this temporal (event-based) information more precisely. Adjacency-matrixbased visualizations of temporal networks are under-investigated in related literature and present a promising research direction for network visualization. Our approach AdMaTilE (Adjacency Matrix and Timeline Explorer) is designed to visualize event-based networks using multiple matrix views, timelines, difference maps, and staged transitions.},

	abstract     = {Networks are abstract and flexible data structures that model entities and relationships between them. Network visualization encompasses techniques, designed to produce aesthetic and scalable layouts of such data. In real-world applications data changes over time and investigating and analyzing these dynamics is of interest, motivating the study of dynamic network visualization. Dynamic network visualization explores how networks evolve and how these changes can be effectively conveyed. The goal is to construct representations depicting both structural and temporal information in a readable manner. This is a challenging task and current approaches often optimize standard network representations (i.e., node-link diagrams) to simultaneously portray topology and dynamics using animation. Alternative visualization modalities are seldom explored, presenting an interesting research direction. As network connectivity can be cumbersome to visualize, approaches make use of space to improve readability and implement aesthetic criteria, often presenting scalability concerns. These limitations pose interesting research questions that are investigated in this dissertation. Namely, how can we augment standard network visualization techniques to convey dynamics, which techniques are appropriate, effective, and avoid information overload, and are alternative visualization metaphors for dynamic networks useful? We contribute to dynamic network visualization by formally evaluating the design space and investigating novel dynamic network visualization approaches. Our results show promise for alternative visualization modalities and our evaluation of structural and temporal encodings highlights the usefulness of under-investigated combinations in related literature. Furthermore, we outline research challenges that present future work opportunities and provide recommendations to support researchers in developing dynamic network visualization approaches.},

	abstract     = {The richness and potential of the Database of Modern Exhibitions (DoME) lies in its innovative capacity, encompassing a comprehensive collection of more than 1350 Modern Art exhibitions in Europe from 1905 to 1915, documented and collected through printed exhibition catalogues. Due to its large scope, DoME serves as an ideal database for visual analysis, extracting insights, and communicating advances in Digital Art History research. However, creating visually appealing, effective, and intuitive representations of such data is challenging due to its large scale. Providing such overview/summary visualizations and balancing simplicity with meaningful insights that can be extracted is crucial for clearly communicating this information. We propose an approach that leverages the strengths of sparklines combined with interactive features, such as dynamically re-ordering artists’ exhibition activities based on similar behaviour (Similarity Ordering), or Co-Exhibition Activity. This facilitates the tasks of researchers that are investigating patterns and trends, for instance, in Digital Art History. These techniques enable the exploration and understanding of the dynamic trajectories of individual artists’ careers while addressing the challenges associated with summarizing such large scale data. The concept of summarizing and visualizing such large datasets, as exemplified through our proposed approach, can be generalized to various domains. Whether it is depicting exhibition activities in Digital Art History, publication records in scientific research, or stock performance in business analytics, this approach can provide valuable insights into the temporal patterns and relationships within complex datasets. Future opportunities for research are: exploring the multi-dimensional aspects of the data, such as, incorporating additional data dimensions, i.e. artistic styles, geographic locations, age, gender and nationality, providing a more nuanced understanding of the similarities between artists’ exhibition activities.},

We introduce a Visual Analytics approach tailored to this domain, addressing key challenges in exploring the temporal patterns in artists' exhibition behaviors between 1905 and 1915; a pivotal period marking the start of modern Avant-garde artistic movements. Unveiling the exhibition practices of artists by exploring their temporal patterns and exhibition behavior enables domain experts to gain novel perspectives and insights about strategies, collaborations, and influences that shaped 20th-century Avant-gardes. Our transdisciplinary approach, jointly developed by visualization and art history researchers, offers interactive visual representations to support data-driven insights and research for this domain's intricate and complex data. We propose a multiple coordinated views approach that consists of an interactive timeline, dynamic ego network, and structured tabular overview to tackle different research questions, facilitate in-depth analysis, and enable comparison of artists' exhibition behaviors. The outcomes of our evaluation, structured as dual expert interviews, emphasize the intuitiveness of the representations and how data-driven insights can be extracted with the support of our approach. Our paper addresses a compelling problem in Art History, offering an effective Visual Analytics solution and outlining the broader implications and positive outcomes.},

Our proposed approach enables the exploration and analysis of the disruptions' spatial and temporal patterns and delay accumulation to identify vulnerable segments in the railroad network. We assess the effectiveness of our approach through an expert interview highlighting how the accumulation of delays and disruptions is lucidly communicated and provides valuable insights into their spread across the network. We discuss the outcomes of the expert interview alongside the limitations we identified and how we resolve these. Finally, we illustrate directions for future work, including online data to assist railroad planners with real-time monitoring for proactive decision-making and improved operations.},

However, it is unclear which types of uncertainty need to be shown so that appropriate visualizations can be designed. Therefore, we present a novel typology of temporal uncertainty in dynamic networks and their associated diffusion processes. Our paper systematizes where uncertainty can arise.
