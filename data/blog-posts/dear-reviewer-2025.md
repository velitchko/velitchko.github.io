## Dear Reviewer,

You seem tired. Honestly, I get it. **I am too.** 

Every year deadlines pile up, papers multiply, and somehow we act like we can keep up. Reviewing becomes another item on the todo list; among meetings, proposals, teaching, and whatever else comes up. We call it *a service*, put it on our resumes, volunteer for it, act as if it were a noble thing we do. 

The invisible glue that sets quality standards for publications, defines careers, and holds our community together. 

Lately, that same glue feels like it's coming a bit loose, not sticking properly.

I’ve received reviews that were thoughtful and constructive and helped me improve my papers. The kind of reviews that make you think about your framing and contribution. But I’ve also received reviews that were clearly written in a rush. A line or two that completely missed the point. The reviews that make me sit there, staring at the screen, wondering why I spent so much time writing the article, what do I do now, where do I go from here?

Well, I hope I'm not alone in this and I really don’t want to think that any of those reviewers are malicious or incompetent. They’re probably just overworked, burnt out, and still trying to do the right thing in a system that doesn’t give them time to. I’ve experienced it too, reviewing paper after paper, telling myself I’m objective while my focus is elsewhere.

That’s what makes it hard to be angry. Because it’s not just them, it's me and it's you, **it's all of us**. We’re running on fumes and pretending it’s fine. We hold these venues we review for as the gold standard of quality. The *best papers, the most rigorous process*. But how rigorous can that same process be when everyone’s on the brink of (*if not already*) burnt out? 

Good things take time, **good work takes time**. Reading carefully takes time. Writing a thoughtful and constructive review takes time. However, time has become the one thing nobody has anymore. We’re all in a rush to keep up, to show we’re contributing, even if that means doing things halfway.

When I look at the reviews I’ve received, I can tell which ones were written with care and which ones were just box-ticking exercises. You know the ones: “Lacks novelty”, “Unclear contribution”, “Needs more evaluation”. Yeah, been there.

It’s not reviewing. It’s something you do to say you did it. It helps no one. Not a soul.

And yet, the cycle continues. Papers get submitted, reviewed, accepted, published, and celebrated. Venues remain prestigious because, well they’ve always been prestigious. We talk about acceptance rates as if they mean something more than how well you survived reviewer roulette.

I don’t say this to be cynical (or maybe I do). I still believe peer review matters but at this point if we’re being honest it’s not working as intended. The system isn’t failing because people stopped caring. It’s failing because nobody has the time to care properly anymore. The problem isn't apathy, it's bandwidth.

I keep thinking we could learn something from how software communities handle this. Imagine if we treated papers like pull  requests. Right? You open a pull request and someone checks it out and says, “Looks interesting. Maybe clean up this section, clarify that function, fix this bug”. No one replies with “Reject”. They point out what’s broken and how to fix it. The goal isn’t to be destructive its to create something together and get the good to emerge.


Funnily, enough these are just the things that are described in most reviewer guidelines. Asking yourself: What would make this contribution stronger? How can I help it get there?
Now imagine if we reviewed papers like that? This was the idea behind open review but for whatever reason that didn't quite play out well.

To me personally it kind of feels like that meme. The one where someone is reviewing a pull request on GitHub and leaves five nitpicky comments about a variable’s name but waves through a hundred lines of regex with “LGTM”. It’s funny, until you realize that’s exactly what happens in paper reviews too. Entire conceptual frameworks get brushed off with “unclear contribution”, while three sentences debate the use of a term (is network dynamics plural or not?).

What I wish, really, is that reviewing worked more like a good code review. You don’t reject a pull request; you help it merge cleanly. You point out what’s broken, maybe even how to fix it. That’s not lowering the bar. That’s raising the quality of the conversation and helping someone get better.

Maybe part of the problem is that we only ever talk about reviewing as an obligation, *a service to the community*. We never talk about it as a skill. A skill that can be taught, practiced, and improved. 

We expect junior researchers to just pick it up and go, while senior researchers drown in review requests they no longer have time to do properly. The truth is, many seniors assign the reviews to juniors anyway. Done quietly, invisibly. It works I guess? How about if we were more open about this? Identify the problem, discuss potential solutions, and try them out to figure out what works. What if we treated reviewing as a skill; something seniors can teach?

I know, easier said than done. There are practical constraints, and the community is trying to fix some of this. I’ve seen discussions about reviewer fatigue, surveys about experiences, and new experiments to measure quality and load (check the links below). But here’s the part that still sticks with me: the best reviews I’ve ever received didn’t tell me I was wrong. They told me what was wrong, and how to make it better. They weren’t written to judge. They were written to help and improve.

If we want our papers to be worth reading, our reviews have to be worth writing.

So, dear Reviewer, if you’re tired, decline the next review request. It’s fine. The system won’t collapse because you didn’t add one more rushed review to the pile. And when you do have time, when you do have space, come back and review with care. Review like someone who wants the paper to succeed.

I’ll try to do the same.

I don’t have a solution. But I think talking about it matters. The way we review shapes what gets published, what ideas survive, and ultimately what kind of community we become. I wonder if people in other fields feel the same (outside of VIS & HCI). Do you? Does peer review still feel constructive where you are, or is everyone just trying to survive the conference cycle?

Sincerely,
Another tired reviewer.
