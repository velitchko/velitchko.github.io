	abstract = {Uncertainty is common to most types of data, from meteorology to the biomedical sciences. Here, we are interested in the visualization of uncertainty within the context of multivariate graphs, specifically the visualization of uncertainty attached to node attributes. Many visual channels offer themselves up for the visualization of node attributes and their uncertainty. One controversial and relatively under-explored channel, however, is animation, despite its conceptual advantages. In this paper, we investigate node “wiggliness”, i.e. uncertainty-dependent pseudo-random motion of nodes, as a potential new visual channel with which to communicate node attribute uncertainty. To study wiggliness’ effectiveness, we compare it against three other visual channels identified from a thorough review of uncertainty visualization literature—namely node enclosure, node fuzziness, and node color saturation. In a larger-scale, mixed method, Prolific-crowd-sourced, online user study of 160 participants, we quantitatively and qualitatively compare these four uncertainty encodings across eight low-level graph analysis tasks that probe participants’ abilities to parse the presented networks both on an attribute and topological level. We ultimately conclude that all four uncertainty encodings appear comparably useful—as opposed to previous findings. Wiggliness may be a suitable and effective visual channel with which to communicate node attribute uncertainty, at least for the kinds of data and tasks considered in our study.},

In this talk, I explore how visualization helps us make sense of networks in motion, from social systems to infrastructure and beyond. Drawing on metaphors like traffic flow, I compare temporal models, i.e., snapshots, aggregations, and event-based dynamics, and discuss how each supports different kinds of reasoning. I’ll highlight challenges like visual overload, temporal ambiguity, and complexity, and examine a range of visualization strategies, from traditional node-link diagrams to dimensionality reduction techniques.

	abstract = {Art history traditionally relies on qualitative methods. However, the increasing availability of digitized archives has opened new possibilities for research by integrating visual analytics. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the intersection between art history and visual analytics, focusing on network visualization and how it supports researchers in analyzing and understanding complex art historical relationships through nodes (e.g., artists, artworks, institutions) and edges (the relationships between them). We explore how these approaches enable dynamic analysis, offering novel perspectives on artistic influence, stylistic evolution, and social interactions within the art world. Through this, we also examine wedges, a metaphor for the friction often present in art history between individuals and institutions. These tensions, which have historically played a pivotal role in shaping artistic movements, are now better understood through the lens of network visualization, revealing how conflicts and power dynamics influenced the development of art. Through a hierarchical categorization of the literature, we outline saturated problems and research areas as well as ongoing challenges in art historical research. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of visual analytics to bridge the gap between traditional qualitative research and modern computational analysis, offering interactive exploration, temporal analysis, and complex network visualization. We provide a structured foundation for future research in art history, emphasizing the value of network visualization in enriching the understanding of art history.},

	abstract = {The research fields of Process Mining (PM) and Visual Analytics (VA) can mutually benefit from each other by combining their strengths. PM tasks include process discovery, enhancement, and conformance checking. This paper focuses on conformance checking, where the event log is compared against a reference model to identify potential deviations in process behavior. Conformance checking is often limited to analyzing the control flow (i.e., sequences of activities), while other relevant perspectives present in the data, such as resources and time, are frequently overlooked. These additional perspectives are crucial to form a holistic understanding of deviations and their underlying causes. To address these limitations, we propose a conceptual framework and explore future opportunities for integrating VA with PM to support conformance checking from multiple perspectives. Our contribution emphasizes interactive visualization and analysis for a more flexible and iterative conformance checking process by, for example, allowing to dynamically refine and define additional constraints based on insights from multiple perspectives and making all deviations explainable and understandable.},

	abstract = {Physicalizations, which combine perceptual and sensorimotor interactions, offer an immersive way to comprehend complex data visualizations by stimulating active construction and manipulation. This study investigates the impact of personal construction on the comprehension of physicalized networks. We propose a physicalization toolkit—NODKANT—for constructing modular node-link diagrams consisting of a magnetic surface, 3D printable and stackable node labels, and edges of adjustable length. In a mixed-methods between-subject lab study with 27 participants, three groups of people used NODKANT to complete a series of low-level analysis tasks in the context of an animal contact network. The first group was tasked with freely constructing their network using a sorted edge list, the second group received step-by-step instructions to create a predefined layout, and the third group received a pre-constructed representation. While free construction proved on average more time-consuming, we show that users extract more insights from the data during construction and interact with their representation more frequently, compared to those presented with step-by-step instructions. Interestingly, the increased time demand cannot be measured in users' subjective task load. Finally, our findings indicate that participants who constructed their own representations were able to recall more detailed insights after a period of 10–14 days compared to those who were given a pre-constructed network physicalization. All materials, data, code for generating instructions, and 3D printable meshes are available on https://osf.io/tk3g5/.},

	abstract = {From social networks to brain connectivity, ego networks are a simple yet powerful approach to visualizing parts of a larger graph, i.e. those related to a selected focal node — the so-called “ego”. While surveys and comparisons of general graph visualization approaches exist in the literature, we note (i) the many conflicting results of comparisons of adjacency matrices and node-link diagrams, thus motivating further study, as well as (ii) the absence of such systematic comparisons for ego networks specifically. In this paper, we propose the development of empirical recommendations for ego network visualization strategies. First, we survey the literature across application domains and collect examples of network visualizations to identify the most common visual encodings, namely straight-line, radial, and layered node-link diagrams, as well as adjacency matrices. These representations are then applied to a representative, intermediate-sized network and subsequently compared in a large-scale, crowd-sourced user study in a mixed-methods analysis setup to investigate their impact on both user experience and performance. Within the limits of this study, and contrary to previous comparative investigations of adjacency matrices and node-link diagrams (outside of ego networks specifically), participants performed systematically worse when using adjacency matrices than those using node-link diagrammatic representations. Similar to previous comparisons of different node-link diagrams, we do not detect any notable differences in participant performance between the three node-link diagrams. Lastly, our quantitative and qualitative results indicate that participants found adjacency matrices harder to learn, use, and understand than node-link diagrams. We conclude that in terms of both participant experience and performance, a layered node-link diagrammatic representation appears to be the most preferable for ego network visualization purposes.},

Our approach addresses this gap by supporting the identification of geospatial and temporal patterns and offering insights into the multifaceted exhibition behavior of artists in the early 20th century. To demonstrate the efficacy and validate our approach, we present a case study conducted by an art historian in the form of an expert interview. The discussion presents details about insights that were obtained and valuable feedback about the utility of the visual encodings and interactions. By integrating geospatial and temporal facets along with features to perform comparative analysis our approach emerges as a valuable asset for art historians providing a comprehensive look into artists' exhibition histories.},

	abstract = {Networks are abstract and flexible data structures that model entities and relationships between them. Network visualization encompasses techniques, designed to produce aesthetic and scalable layouts of such data. In real-world applications data changes over time and investigating and analyzing these dynamics is of interest, motivating the study of dynamic network visualization. Dynamic network visualization explores how networks evolve and how these changes can be effectively conveyed. The goal is to construct representations depicting both structural and temporal information in a readable manner. This is a challenging task and current approaches often optimize standard network representations (i.e., node-link diagrams) to simultaneously portray topology and dynamics using animation. Alternative visualization modalities are seldom explored, presenting an interesting research direction. As network connectivity can be cumbersome to visualize, approaches make use of space to improve readability and implement aesthetic criteria, often presenting scalability concerns. These limitations pose interesting research questions that are investigated in this dissertation. Namely, how can we augment standard network visualization techniques to convey dynamics, which techniques are appropriate, effective, and avoid information overload, and are alternative visualization metaphors for dynamic networks useful? We contribute to dynamic network visualization by formally evaluating the design space and investigating novel dynamic network visualization approaches. Our results show promise for alternative visualization modalities and our evaluation of structural and temporal encodings highlights the usefulness of under-investigated combinations in related literature. Furthermore, we outline research challenges that present future work opportunities and provide recommendations to support researchers in developing dynamic network visualization approaches.},

Network visualization provides meaningful representations of these data, supporting researchers in understanding the connections, gathering insights, and detecting and identifying unexpected patterns. Research in this field is focusing on increasingly challenging problems, such as visualizing dynamic, complex, multivariate, and geospatial networked data. This ever-growing, and widely varied, body of research led to several surveys being published, each covering one or more disciplines of network visualization. Despite this effort, the variety and complexity of this research represents an obstacle when surveying the domain and building a comprehensive overview of the literature. Furthermore, there exists a lack of clarification and uniformity between the terminology used in each of the surveys, which requires further effort when mapping and categorizing the plethora of different visualization techniques and approaches. In this paper, we aim at providing researchers and practitioners alike with a “roadmap” detailing the current research trends in the field of network visualization. We design our contribution as a meta-survey where we discuss, summarize, and categorize recent surveys and task taxonomies published in the context of network visualization. We identify more and less saturated disciplines of research and consolidate the terminology used in the surveyed literature. We also survey the available task taxonomies, providing a comprehensive analysis of their varying support to each network visualization discipline and by establishing and discussing a classification for the individual tasks. With this combined analysis of surveys and task taxonomies, we provide an overarching structure of the field, from which we extrapolate the current state of research and promising directions for future work.},

Most studies explore the temporal dimension and diverse interaction techniques supporting the participants, focusing on a single structural representation. Empirical evidence about performance and preference for different visualization approaches is scattered over different studies, experimental settings, and tasks. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the dynamic network visualization design space in two evaluations. First, a controlled study assessing participants' response times, accuracy, and preferences for different combinations of network structural and temporal representations on typical dynamic network exploration tasks, with and without the support of standard interaction methods. Second, the best-performing combinations from the first study are enhanced based on participants' feedback and evaluated in a heuristic-based qualitative study with visualization experts on a real-world network. Our results highlight node-link with animation and playback controls as the best-performing combination and the most preferred based on ratings. Matrices achieve similar performance to node-link in the first study but have considerably lower scores in our second evaluation. Similarly, juxtaposition exhibits evident scalability issues in more realistic analysis contexts.},

	abstract = {The richness and potential of the Database of Modern Exhibitions (DoME) lies in its innovative capacity, encompassing a comprehensive collection of more than 1350 Modern Art exhibitions in Europe from 1905 to 1915, documented and collected through printed exhibition catalogues. Due to its large scope, DoME serves as an ideal database for visual analysis, extracting insights, and communicating advances in Digital Art History research. However, creating visually appealing, effective, and intuitive representations of such data is challenging due to its large scale. Providing such overview/summary visualizations and balancing simplicity with meaningful insights that can be extracted is crucial for clearly communicating this information. We propose an approach that leverages the strengths of sparklines combined with interactive features, such as dynamically re-ordering artists’ exhibition activities based on similar behaviour (Similarity Ordering), or Co-Exhibition Activity. This facilitates the tasks of researchers that are investigating patterns and trends, for instance, in Digital Art History. These techniques enable the exploration and understanding of the dynamic trajectories of individual artists’ careers while addressing the challenges associated with summarizing such large scale data. The concept of summarizing and visualizing such large datasets, as exemplified through our proposed approach, can be generalized to various domains. Whether it is depicting exhibition activities in Digital Art History, publication records in scientific research, or stock performance in business analytics, this approach can provide valuable insights into the temporal patterns and relationships within complex datasets. Future opportunities for research are: exploring the multi-dimensional aspects of the data, such as, incorporating additional data dimensions, i.e. artistic styles, geographic locations, age, gender and nationality, providing a more nuanced understanding of the similarities between artists’ exhibition activities.},

We introduce a Visual Analytics approach tailored to this domain, addressing key challenges in exploring the temporal patterns in artists' exhibition behaviors between 1905 and 1915; a pivotal period marking the start of modern Avant-garde artistic movements. Unveiling the exhibition practices of artists by exploring their temporal patterns and exhibition behavior enables domain experts to gain novel perspectives and insights about strategies, collaborations, and influences that shaped 20th-century Avant-gardes. Our transdisciplinary approach, jointly developed by visualization and art history researchers, offers interactive visual representations to support data-driven insights and research for this domain's intricate and complex data. We propose a multiple coordinated views approach that consists of an interactive timeline, dynamic ego network, and structured tabular overview to tackle different research questions, facilitate in-depth analysis, and enable comparison of artists' exhibition behaviors. The outcomes of our evaluation, structured as dual expert interviews, emphasize the intuitiveness of the representations and how data-driven insights can be extracted with the support of our approach.

	abstract = {Cultural object collections attract and delight spectators since ancient times. Yet, they also easily overwhelm visitors due to their perceptual richness and associated information. Similarly, digitized collections appear as complex, multifaceted phenomena, which can be challenging to grasp and navigate. Though visualizations can create various types of collection overviews for that matter, they do not easily assemble into a "big picture" or lead to an integrated understanding. We introduce coherence techniques to maximize connections between multiple views and apply them to the prototype PolyCube system of collection visualization: with map, set, and network visualizations it makes spatial, categorical, and relational collection aspects visible. For the essential temporal dimension, it offers four different views: superimposition, animation, juxtaposition, and space-time cube representations. A user study confirmed that better integrated visualizations support synoptic, cross-dimensional insights. An outlook is dedicated to the system's applicability within other arts and humanities data domains.},

To address this question, we present a novel visualization for interactive analysis of multiple biographical timelines connected to Austrian music history. Instead of simply comparing the biographies of over 200 composers, musicians, and conductors in a linear fashion, we connect them with the urban processes that constituted the topos \`Music City Vienna´, such as street-naming, awards, anniversaries, and exhibitions. The proposed approach intertwines people, events, and locations, allowing the interactive analysis of multi-modal data. Our main goal is to explore continuities and discontinuities, to find underlying trends and different narratives. Ultimately, this work is intended to stimulate the discussion on the challenges of performing visual analytics of historical data.},

 one hand, historical ouevres and lifework collections can be newly visualized for different audiences. On the other hand, biographical
 trajectories can be represented and analyzed in an unforeseen manner. But how do visualizations of life and work go together?
 With this paper we reflect on ways and means how to shed light on the life of artists or other historical actors by the means of
 metadata provided by their ouevre. By representing the works of Charles W. Cushman in the PolyCube framework for cultural
 collection visualization, we shed light on aspects of his biography in a geo-temporal and categorial-temporal information space. We
 discuss how these visual-analytical frames of reference could be combined for their mutual contextualization, and how they can be
 hybridized with textual sources to provide a multimodal, narrative framework of biographical knowledge exploration and communication.},

A typical CV is comprised of multiple sections associated with spatio-temporal, nominal, hierarchical, and ordinal data. The main task of a recruiter is, given a job application with specific requirements, to compare and assess CVs in order to build a short list of promising candidates to interview. Commonly, this is done by viewing CVs in a side-by-side fashion. This becomes challenging when comparing more than two CVs, because the reader is required to switch attention between them. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the CVs are structured similarly, thus making the overview cluttered and significantly slowing down the comparison process. In order to address these challenges, in this paper we propose "CV3", an interactive exploration environment offering users a new way to explore, assess, and compare multiple CVs, to suggest suitable candidates for specific job requirements. We validate our system by means of domain expert feedback whose results highlight both the efficacy of our approach and its limitations. We learned that CV3 eases the overall burden of recruiters thereby assisting them in the selection process.},

While many visualization systems provide overview and exploration options for non-expert audiences or casual users, others support the in-depth analysis of collection experts like curators or art historians. These visualizations often rely on object metadata, which have been generated from historical catalogs or textual sources, each with their own standards of precision, certainty, and data quality. To make these levels of data quality transparent, the visualization of uncertainty poses a vital challenge for interfaces across the board. We introduce the PolyCube system as a visualization framework which provides four different perspectives on the geo-temporal origins of cultural collection data, including coordinated multiple views, animation, color coding, and a space-time cube representation. With specific regard to this multi-perspective framework we develop options to visualize spatio-temporal uncertainty and discuss ways and means of their coherent implementation.},

R. Martin. The amount of information to display and the complexity of the relationships between the characters proved this task to be difficult, therefore we propose a radial layout designed to reduce clutter and enhance readability, which is suitable also to an audience not familiar with the show.

This information by itself is comprehensible - it is very clear when, where, and for how long a person has worked or studied. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a clear overview when comparing multiple resumes, specifically their chronological information. Navigating back and forth between resumes, switching between views and attempting to compare every single event is highly inefficient. The most common and intuitive way to compare events from multiple resumes, would be to view them in a side-by-side fashion. Many similarities can be quickly recognized by doing this, but in cases where more than two resumes need to be compared simultaneously, the overview becomes cluttered, the amount of information increases substantially and comparing events becomes a difficult task. We propose the design and implementation of a web application - CV3 - that is capable of comparing multiple chronologies and visualizing the output in a clear manner, whilst maintaining a clean overview. Our approach supports users in filtering timeline events across all resumes, recognizing and extracting relevant information from resumes and visualizing their similarities efficiently in a single overview.},
